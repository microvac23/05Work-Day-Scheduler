# 05Work-Day-Scheduler

## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given I am using a daily planner to create a schedule, when I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When I scroll down, then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
When I view the time blocks for that day then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When I click into a time block, then I can enter an event.
When I click the save button for that time block then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist
